Every morning he walks his dog at the beach to get a glimpse of his crush, Kahori Harukawa, as she rides the waves on her surfboard, and walks to school together with his childhood friend, Natsuki Suzuura. Everything changed on a sunny spring morning when he stumbled across Ryouichi Kyougoku, a handsome new transfer student who claims to be a psychic, musing about how amazing it was that he was finally on Earth... Nerawareta Gakuen tells the relationship-driven story of how Ryouichi's presence sets the wheels of fate in motion for Kenji. Not only are his ordinary days challenged by growing jealousy from seeing Kahori falling for the young psychic, but his friend Natsuki seems to be troubled by problems of her own. And then he still has to deal with whatever plans Ryouichi has in store for him.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 54799, "type": "manga", "name": "Nerawareta Gakuen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/54799/Nerawareta_Gakuen"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}, {"mal_id": 109, "type": "anime", "name": "Shochiku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/109/Shochiku"}, {"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 1233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1233/Bandai_Namco_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 595, "type": "anime", "name": "NYAV Post", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/595/NYAV_Post"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Giniro Hikousen (\u9280\u8272\u98db\u884c\u8239)\" by supercell"], "ending_themes": ["\"Sayonara no Hashi (\u30b5\u30e8\u30ca\u30e9\u306e\u6a4b)\" by Mayu Watanabe"]}
