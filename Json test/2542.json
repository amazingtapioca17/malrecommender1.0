The girl lives ignoring the terrible secret hidden in the golden bracelet on her hand. Her \"Father\" and Her \"brothers\", Abel and Arthur, love her dearly, but her \"mother\" considers her an intruder and doesn't manage to open her heart to the girl. Georgie grows up into a beautiful young girl, and both her \"brothers\" are deeply in love with her. Not knowing the truth, Georgie eventually falls in love with the handsome grandson of the British Governor. When Mother finally reveals the truth to her and condemns the girl for being an exile's daughter, Georgie leaves for Britain in search of her real parents - and for her love, who has also left Australia. Abel and Arthur follow her and the three are thrown into the cruel world of London aristocracy, lies and intrigues.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 1983", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 2685, "type": "manga", "name": "Georgie", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/2685/Georgie"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 142, "type": "anime", "name": "Asatsu DK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/142/Asatsu_DK"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 65, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokyo Movie Shinsha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/65/Tokyo_Movie_Shinsha"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "opening_themes": ["''Wasurareta Message'' by Yamamoto Yuriko"], "ending_themes": ["\"Yasashisa wo Arigatou\" by Yamamoto Yuriko"]}
