The rich seek to satisfy their desires and derive pleasure for themselves, and Tokyo has materialized into such a city as a result. Saiga, once a war photographer, works for Hibara Ginza in the capitalist state of Tokyo. He infiltrates the Roppongi Club, a secretive base located in the red light district of the city, to collect information about them. However, he was caught in the process and brought forward to a girl called Kagura who was in the midst of a ritual. His contact with Kagura awakens his special ability: the power to make things explode when photographed. In order to unravel the mystery behind the Roppongi Club and Kagura, Saiga begins his solitary battle.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2005", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 5434, "type": "manga", "name": "Speed Grapher", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/5434/Speed_Grapher"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 55, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Asahi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/55/TV_Asahi"}, {"mal_id": 318, "type": "anime", "name": "WAO World", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/318/WAO_World"}, {"mal_id": 416, "type": "anime", "name": "TAP", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/416/TAP"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Gonzo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/3/Gonzo"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Girls on Film\" by Duran Duran\"Shutter Speed\" by Shinkichi Mitsumune [U.S. Version]"], "ending_themes": ["\"Hinageshi no Oka (Hill of Poppies)\" by Shione Yukawa (eps 1-12)", "\"Break the Cocoon\" By Yoriko (eps 13-24)"]}
