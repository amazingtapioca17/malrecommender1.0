It is a Netflix-exclusive show and will be dropping for South Korean Netflix for sure, other countries will receive it as well, which is a fairly smart move considering the show is dialogue-less.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Prequel": [{"mal_id": 31674, "type": "anime", "name": "Larva 3rd Season", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31674/Larva_3rd_Season"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
