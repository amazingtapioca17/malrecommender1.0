Together with his friends, Parappa gets into many strange situations, all the while learning to navigate through life, get along with his friends, and pine for the girl of his dreams, Sunny Funny. Based on an equally quirky rhythm game, Parappa the Rapper boasts a unique flat style, blasts of color, and a string of strange but charming characters. Among Parappa\u2019s friends are an anthropomorphized blue cat, lamb, and even a flower. Parappa's adventures range from the ordinary to the bizarre. He crosses paths with mischievous baddies, helps resolve questions of friendship and love, and even goes on trips through time itself. Nothing can change Parappa's positive outlook on life.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2001", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Other": [{"mal_id": 33835, "type": "anime", "name": "PJ Berri no Mogumogu Munyamunya", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/33835/PJ_Berri_no_Mogumogu_Munyamunya"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Love Together (Parappa Rapper Mix) (LOVE TOGETHER~\u30d1\u30e9\u30c3\u30d1\u30e9\u30c3\u30d1\u30fcMIX~)\" by Nona Reeves (eps 1-15)", "\"Attitude\" by Crystal Kay (eps 16-30)"], "ending_themes": ["\"School Girl\" by BENNIE K.
