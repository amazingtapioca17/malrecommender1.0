Prior to the events of the series, mankind waged a battle of survival against the Grimm before discovering the power of a mysterious element called Dust which allowed them to fight back against the monsters. In the present day, Dust is used to augment people's abilities and powers. Those who train to battle the Grimm are known as Huntsmen or Huntresses.[17] The series focuses on four girls, each with her own unique weapon and powers. Together, they form team RWBY (\"ruby\") at Beacon Academy in the kingdom of Vale, where they are trained to become Huntresses alongside team JNPR (\"juniper\"), team SSSN (\"sun\"), team CRDL (\"cardinal\"), team CFVY (\"coffee\"), and various other student teams.[18][19] When numerous Dust thefts, organized by local crime lord Roman Torchwick, sweep through the kingdom's eponymous capital (home of Beacon), Team RWBY begin investigating the thefts on their own accord. This brings them into conflict with Torchwick and an associate, Cinder Fall\u2212whose ulterior motives require the stockpiling of the volatile commodity. Fall's plan is to lead the White Fang\u2212a terrorist group seeking equality for the human/animal hybrid Faunus race\u2212in a terror attack on the Vytal Festival, an annual inter-academy competition. In the chaos, Cinder seizes power from a deeper conspiracy woven amongst the academy Headmasters. Through Volumes 4 and 5, a scattered Team RWBY each make their way to Haven Academy in Mistral, which brings them (intentionally and otherwise) into conflict with Cinder, new and old villains, and their master Salem, the series' antagonist.", "background": "The future-fantasy world of Remnant is filled with ravenous monsters, treacherous terrain, and more villains than you can shake a sniper-scythe at.
