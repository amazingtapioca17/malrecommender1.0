Shougo himself is mostly concerned with riding his motorcycle and picking up beautiful women like Yui Takanaka, who aspires to be a dancer. Shougo's life suddenly changes when his friend, Shinji Nakagawa, shows him a top-secret project: the \"Garland,\" an advanced motorcycle that can transform into a robot. Ambushed by the military, Shougo hijacks the Garland and escapes into the city.
