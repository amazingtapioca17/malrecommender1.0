One day at school, the young girl chokes down her milk and vegetables and promptly faints from the shock. When she wakes up in the nurse\u2019s office, she comes face to face with Ninninman, Piman and Milk, three food sprites that only appear when Mari drinks her milk and eats her carrots and peppers. Though Mari is less than enthusiastic about being haunted by her most hated foodstuffs, can the three spirits help her realize the importance of friendship, and maybe even teach her to finish her meals?
