His academy rigidly divides up the student body into classes based on the results of tests. The prodigies are in the A class with reclining seats complete with air conditioning, but Akihisa is in F class, the lowest rung of the school ladder which is furnished only with low, decrepit tables and worn-out straw tatami mats. A girl named Mizuki Himeji is actually one of the smartest girls in Akihisa's sophomore year, but she had a fever on test day and was pigeonholed into the F class. Besides Mizuki (who Akihisa secretly adores), the F class also has Yuuji Sakamoto, the class president who has been Akihisa's friend and partner-in-crime since the freshman year. The school happens to have developed experiments to summon fantasy creatures, and Akihisa decides to rally F class to take on the higher-tiered classes and seize their perks. The F class uses the summoned creatures in an all-out battle for school supremacy.", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2010", "broadcast": "Thursdays at 02:20 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 12295, "type": "manga", "name": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/12295/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu"}], "Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 7805, "type": "anime", "name": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Mondai - Christmas ni Tsuite Kotae Nasai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/7805/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu__Mondai_-_Christmas_ni_Tsuite_Kotae_Nasai"}], "Side story": [{"mal_id": 7870, "type": "anime", "name": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/7870/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu_Specials"}, {"mal_id": 36250, "type": "anime", "name": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu Mini Anime", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36250/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu_Mini_Anime"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 9471, "type": "anime", "name": "Baka to Test to Shoukanjuu: Matsuri", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/9471/Baka_to_Test_to_Shoukanjuu__Matsuri"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}, {"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 619, "type": "anime", "name": "Cospa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/619/Cospa"}, {"mal_id": 1015, "type": "anime", "name": "T.O Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1015/TO_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 300, "type": "anime", "name": "Silver Link.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/300/Silver_Link"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Perfect-area complete!\" by Natsuko Asou"], "ending_themes": ["\"Baka Go Home\" by milktub (eps 1-6, 10-13)", "\"Hare Tokidoki Egao\" by Hitomi Harada, Kaori Mizuhashi, Emiri Katou, and Tomomi Isomura (eps 7-9)"]}
