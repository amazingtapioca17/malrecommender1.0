The official announcement will be made in the September issue (on sale August 10) of Newtype magazine in Japan. The Gainax/Khara franchise spinoff spoofs the psychological science fiction drama by reimagining the characters as classmates in Tokyo-3's Nerv School, headed by Principal Gend\u014d Ikari and Misato-sensei. The student body includes three different Rei \"sisters,\" the EVA-01 mobile weapon reimagined as the school bully Evanch\u014d, and the ill-fated Jet Alone robot as JA-ko, a \"hidden character\" in the form of a shy android girl. Ryuusuke Hamamoto created the character designs which has inspired four-panel gag manga serializations in four different magazines: Monthly Sh\u014dnen Ace, Newtype, Dengeki Hobby Magazine, and Figure Oh. The Petit Eva project has also developed merchandising from super-deformed figurines to limited edition Doritos corn chips.\" (Source: MoonPhase)", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 25632, "type": "manga", "name": "Petit Eva: Evangelion@School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/25632/Petit_Eva__EvangelionSchool"}, {"mal_id": 25633, "type": "manga", "name": "Petit Eva Bokura Tanken Doukoukai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/25633/Petit_Eva_Bokura_Tanken_Doukoukai"}], "Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 1588, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Channel", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1588/Bandai_Channel"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}, {"mal_id": 330, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanaban Graphics", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/330/Kanaban_Graphics"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
