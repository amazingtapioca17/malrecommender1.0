While Toei was proud of how it turned out, the Japanese art style made it less easy to sell, and there were technical reasons for not using it, like with animating Ladybug's spots. Instead of making the show in an anime style, the crew went with it being a CGI series, which offered less technical problems and felt more natural.\" An OVA series from Toei has also been noted to be in production, and they are credited creatively on the Western cartoon.", "background": "Set in modern-day Paris, the series focuses on teenagers[13][14][a] Marinette Dupain-Cheng and her classmate and crush Adrien Agreste.[16] When evil arises, Marinette transforms into her secret superhero persona Ladybug, while Adrien transforms into his superhero persona Cat Noir, using powerful objects known as the Miraculous.
