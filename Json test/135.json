One day, while searching through his grandfather's attic, he comes across an old Go board. Upon touching the Go board, Hikaru is possessed by the spirit of Fujiwara no Sai, and continues to be haunted by him soon after. Sai was once a great Go player, who committed suicide and continued to stay in the world as a spirit desiring only to play Go once again. Finally bending to Sai's pleas, Hikaru allows Sai to play Go through himself, unknowingly attempting the first game with the young prodigy Touya Akira. Time has finally started moving, as Sai's quest for the perfect game, \"The Hand of God\", is set underway. Based on the manga by Yumi Hotta and Takeshi Obata.", "background": null, "premiered": "Fall 2001", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 20, "type": "manga", "name": "Hikaru no Go", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/20/Hikaru_no_Go"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 645, "type": "anime", "name": "Hikaru no Go: Kita Hokutohai e no Michi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/645/Hikaru_no_Go__Kita_Hokutohai_e_no_Michi"}], "Summary": [{"mal_id": 2336, "type": "anime", "name": "Hikaru no Go: New Year Special", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2336/Hikaru_no_Go__New_Year_Special"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 10765, "type": "anime", "name": "Hikaru no Go: Tokubetsu-hen - Sabaki no Ichikyoku!
