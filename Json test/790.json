Thousands of years ago, a global ecological catastrophe doomed the planet; now, life outside these domes is virtually impossible. To expedite mankind's recovery, \"AutoReivs,\" humanoid-like robots, have been created to assist people in their day-to-day lives. However, AutoReivs have begun contracting an enigmatic disease called the \"Cogito Virus\" which grants them self-awareness. Re-l Mayer, granddaughter of Romdo's ruler, is assigned to investigate this phenomenon alongside her AutoReiv partner Iggy. But what begins as a routine investigation quickly spirals into a conspiracy as Re-l is confronted by humanity's darkest sins. Elsewhere in Romdo, an AutoReiv specialist by the name of Vincent Law must also face his demons when surreal events begin occurring around him. Re-l, Iggy, Vincent, and the child AutoReiv named Pino, will form an unlikely faction as they struggle to uncover Romdo's mysteries and ultimately, discover the true purpose of the mythical beings called \"Proxies.\" [Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2006", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 19:00 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 10954, "type": "manga", "name": "Ergo Proxy: Centzon Hitchers and Undertaker", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/10954/Ergo_Proxy__Centzon_Hitchers_and_Undertaker"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Universal Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 765, "type": "anime", "name": "Sakura Create", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/765/Sakura_Create"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Manglobe", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/32/Manglobe"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Kiri\" by MONORAL (eps 3-23)"], "ending_themes": ["\"Paranoid Android\" by Radiohead"]}
