He jump out of the window on the third floor of the school to try to commit suicide. However, he miraculously regained his life. At the hospital where he was brought in, Kenichi will be in the same room as Jun Hayashi, an older kid who is suffering from heart disease and can only move in a wheelchair. Students from class come visit Kenichi with his mother. He didn't have a lively face and found out that the class thinks he fell out of the window as an accident while cleaning it and told his mother that which she believes. Jun has a brighter outlook on life and shows Kenichi his drive to live even though the world is so against him. They two grow closer together and vow to eat great ramen one day. The night before Jun's surgery they accomplish that ramen journey and on the way to the operating room, Jun yells at Kenichi \"if you commit suicide, give me your life. If you don't need it, please give it to me!\" Everyday Kenichi gets to eat good food, play good games, and do whatever he wants (even to go to school, he can even change schools too) which Jun never even has the opportunity to do because of his heart. Kenichi's will to live is reignited, because there are people out there will even less who would gladly trade their life for his bullied one.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
