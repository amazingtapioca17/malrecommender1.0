It is considered an absolute fate that everyone lives by\u2014even people whose actions lead to bloodshed and tears. Using magical abilities known as the Fonic Arts, a war between the nation of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear and the Malkuth Empire is waged in hopes of bringing the Score's foreseen utopia to life. Tales of the Abyss follows Luke von Fabre, who spends his days locked away in his manor after being kidnapped and losing memories as a child. One day, while honing his swordsmanship, a woman named Tear attempts to assassinate his master. Luke defends him, but the clash results in the two being teleported to a distant land. Luke and Tear\u2019s journey back quickly escalates into a quest that will either free the world from the Score's chains or destroy it completely.", "background": null, "premiered": "Fall 2008", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1756, "type": "manga", "name": "Tales of the Abyss", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1756/Tales_of_the_Abyss"}], "Side story": [{"mal_id": 8754, "type": "anime", "name": "Tales of the Abyss Special Fan Disc", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8754/Tales_of_the_Abyss_Special_Fan_Disc"}], "Character": [{"mal_id": 12699, "type": "anime", "name": "Tales of Gekijou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12699/Tales_of_Gekijou"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 140, "type": "anime", "name": "Animax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/140/Animax"}, {"mal_id": 1097, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Namco Games", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1097/Bandai_Namco_Games"}, {"mal_id": 1175, "type": "anime", "name": "Atelier Musa", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1175/Atelier_Musa"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Karma (\u30ab\u30eb\u30de)\" by BUMP OF CHICKEN (eps 1-26)"], "ending_themes": ["\"Bouken Suisei (\u5192\u967a\u5f57\u661f)\" by Kurumi Enumoto (eps 1-26)"]}
