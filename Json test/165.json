During that same day, he is attacked by government officials but a woman named Haruka comes to his rescue, informing him that she was sent to get him by the Organization TERRA, and that Tokyo had been sealed in a time rift where time flows one third as fast as the outside world. He flees from Haruka onto a train where he sees Reika once more. Arriving at the Room of Rah, he follows her to a tremendous egg where the Dolem RahXephon is hatched from, and upon her singing his mother appears atop the Dolem that had stopped the TERRA Invasion. In the battle Ayato's mother is injured, and Ayato flees Tokyo Jupiter with Haruka.", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2002", "broadcast": "Mondays at 16:25 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 216, "type": "manga", "name": "RahXephon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/216/RahXephon"}, {"mal_id": 4566, "type": "manga", "name": "RahXephon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/4566/RahXephon"}], "Side story": [{"mal_id": 559, "type": "anime", "name": "RahXephon Kansoukyoku: Kanojo to Kanojo Jishin to - Thatness and Thereness", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/559/RahXephon_Kansoukyoku__Kanojo_to_Kanojo_Jishin_to_-_Thatness_and_Thereness"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 758, "type": "anime", "name": "RahXephon: Tagen Hensoukyoku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/758/RahXephon__Tagen_Hensoukyoku"}], "Summary": [{"mal_id": 5288, "type": "anime", "name": "RahXephon Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5288/RahXephon_Specials"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 142, "type": "anime", "name": "Asatsu DK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/142/Asatsu_DK"}, {"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Bones", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/4/Bones"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Hemisphere\" by Maaya Sakamoto (eps 2-3, 5-25)", "\"Hemisphere (Instrumental)\" by Maaya Sakamoto (ep 4)"], "ending_themes": ["\"Yume no Tamago\" (\"Fledgling Dream\" English version) by Ichiko and Mayumi Hashimoto (ep 1, 5, 15-16, 19, 25)", "\"Yume no Tamago\" by Ichiko Hashimoto and Mayumi Hashimoto (eps 2-4, 6-14, 17-18, 20-24)", "\"Before You Know\" by Ichiko Hashimoto (ep 26)"]}
