Through these prosthetics, the weak are made strong, and the dying are given new life. Public Security Section 9 of Niihama City (a fictional setting inspired by Hong Kong), a diverse team of AI, cyborgs and unmodified humans, must investigate cases of corruption and terrorism. Major Motoko Kusanagi has full-body prosthetics, owing to a childhood accident. She, her second in command Batou and information specialist Ishikawa have been assigned an important task: to investigate a hacker known only as \"The Puppetmaster.\" But as Motoko and her team discover, things are never so simple. Ghost in the Shell is a futuristic thriller with intense action scenes mixed with slower artistic sequences and many philosophical questions about one's soul, gender and human identity in such an advanced age of technology.", "background": "Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell was the first film to adapt Masumane Shirow's manga of the same name. It heavily condenses the original storyline, reducing the original material's comic relief and sexual content in favor of a more serious tone and changing the setting from Japan to a city modelled after Hong Kong. The artwork within the animated film was produced using an innovative mix of cel animation and digital effects. Ghost in the Shell is one of the world's most famous Japanese animated films, being the first to reach #1 on Billboard magazine's video best-seller list, and also served as a major inspiration for the Wachowskis in their creation of the Matrix movies. A special edition titled Ghost in the Shell: 2.0 was released in 2008, which features scenes reanimated with additional CGI to match the style of the 2004's sequel, Ghost in the Shell: Innocence.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1023, "type": "manga", "name": "Koukaku Kidoutai: The Ghost in the Shell", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1023/Koukaku_Kidoutai__The_Ghost_in_the_Shell"}], "Alternative setting": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell__Stand_Alone_Complex"}, {"mal_id": 27411, "type": "anime", "name": "Ghost in the Shell (2015)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/27411/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2015"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 468, "type": "anime", "name": "Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2__Innocence"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 4672, "type": "anime", "name": "Ghost in the Shell 2.0", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4672/Ghost_in_the_Shell_20"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 159, "type": "anime", "name": "Kodansha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/159/Kodansha"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 947, "type": "anime", "name": "Manga Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/947/Manga_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Police", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Police"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}, {"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Making of a Cyborg\" Kenji Kawai"], "ending_themes": ["Reincarnation by Kenji Kawai"]}
