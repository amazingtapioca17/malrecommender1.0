One morning Nagisa comes across a woman dressed in a strange uniform who seems to stare at her, unnerving Nagisa. Later that day, whilst staring out the window, Nagisa becomes aware of a ball bouncing by itself which flings itself towards her window seat, shattering the glass yet not harming her... Turning back to the front she finds a gaping mouth bristling with teeth inches from her face and no-one else about. She screams and the world returns to normal with her standing and the centre of curiosity of her class... why did she scream?", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 49629, "type": "manga", "name": "Iczer Densetsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/49629/Iczer_Densetsu"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 2292, "type": "anime", "name": "Bouken!
