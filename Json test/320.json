She is being controlled by a corrupt cop who gives her targets to kill, detailing to her the crimes these men have committed in order to justify their death.

When another orphan, a teenage boy called Oburi, is brought in to assist Sawa, the two teenage killers form a bond of sorts. As they heal each other's emotional wounds, they begin to dream of a life that would not be spent under the shadows of murder.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Character": [{"mal_id": 221, "type": "anime", "name": "Mezzo Forte", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/221/Mezzo_Forte"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 3323, "type": "anime", "name": "Kite Liberator", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3323/Kite_Liberator"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 152, "type": "anime", "name": "Green Bunny", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/152/Green_Bunny"}, {"mal_id": 1139, "type": "anime", "name": "BEAM Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1139/BEAM_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Arms", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/38/Arms"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 12, "type": "anime", "name": "Hentai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/12/Hentai"}, {"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Police", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/39/Police"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
