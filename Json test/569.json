The perfect plan...until he wandered into a hostage situation and somehow managed to save an Admiral! Now Tylor, a man who wouldn't know what discipline was if it bit him in the backside, has been made Captain of the space cruiser Soyokaze! The crew of this rundown ship is the craziest, rag-tag team of misfits you're ever likely to see, and they're not too fond of their complacent new leader. But they had better learn to work together, because they're about to go head to head with the mighty Raalgon Empire! For better or for worse, the Earth's fate has been placed in the hands of a man who's either a total idiot, or an absolute genius...
