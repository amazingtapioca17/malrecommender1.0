Written by Hideaki Anno, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a heroic tale of a young boy who will become a legend. But as this psychological drama unfolds, ancient secrets beneath the big picture begin to bubble to the surface... [Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Director Hideaki Anno's depression is what led to the dark themes of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Budgetary problems and parental complaints about content led to the original ending being scrapped and replaced with an extremely limited-animation ending breaking from the main plot. A movie, End of Evangelion, was later made based in part on the original planned ending and in part on Anno's increasing frustration with the otaku fanbase. The series' mix of psychoanalysis, religious symbolism, and genre deconstruction proved extremely influential on mature anime in the late '90s onward. The Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006 ranked it as the most popular anime of all time.", "premiered": "Fall 1995", "broadcast": "Wednesdays at 18:30 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 698, "type": "manga", "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/698/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion"}], "Summary": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/31/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion__Death___Rebirth"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 32, "type": "anime", "name": "Neon Genesis Evangelion: The End of Evangelion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/32/Neon_Genesis_Evangelion__The_End_of_Evangelion"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 2759, "type": "anime", "name": "Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/2759/Evangelion__10_You_Are_Not_Alone"}, {"mal_id": 3784, "type": "anime", "name": "Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3784/Evangelion__20_You_Can_Not_Advance"}, {"mal_id": 3785, "type": "anime", "name": "Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3785/Evangelion__30_You_Can_Not_Redo"}, {"mal_id": 3786, "type": "anime", "name": "Evangelion: 3.0+1.0", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3786/Evangelion__30_10"}], "Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 4130, "type": "anime", "name": "Petit Eva: Evangelion@School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4130/Petit_Eva__EvangelionSchool"}], "Other": [{"mal_id": 23023, "type": "anime", "name": "Peaceful Times (F02) Petit Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/23023/Peaceful_Times_F02_Petit_Film"}, {"mal_id": 28149, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Animator Mihonichi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/28149/Nihon_Animator_Mihonichi"}, {"mal_id": 38055, "type": "anime", "name": "Evangelion: Another Impact (VR)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/38055/Evangelion__Another_Impact_VR"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 139, "type": "anime", "name": "Nihon Ad Systems", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/139/Nihon_Ad_Systems"}, {"mal_id": 1461, "type": "anime", "name": "Audio Tanaka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1461/Audio_Tanaka"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Gainax", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/6/Gainax"}, {"mal_id": 103, "type": "anime", "name": "Tatsunoko Production", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/103/Tatsunoko_Production"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 5, "type": "anime", "name": "Dementia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/5/Dementia"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 18, "type": "anime", "name": "Mecha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/18/Mecha"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Zankoku na Tenshi no Thesis (\u6b8b\u9177\u306a\u5929\u4f7f\u306e\u30c6\u30fc\u30bc, A Cruel Angel's Thesis)\" by Yoko Takahashi"], "ending_themes": ["\"Fly Me to the Moon\" by Claire", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Rei #5 Version)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (ep 5)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Rei #6 Version)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (ep 6)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon -4 Beat Version-\" by Yoko Takahashi (eps 7,12)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Aya Bossa Techno Version)\" by Aya (eps 8,22)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Yoko Takahashi Acid Bossa Version)\" by Yoko Takahashi (eps 9,13)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Yoko Takahashi Version)\" by Yoko Takahashi (eps 10,14,21)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon -4 Beat Version (Off-Vocal)-\" by [Instrumental] (ep 15)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Off-Vocal Version)\" by [Instrumental] (eps 16,24)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Aki Jungle Version)\" by Aki (ep 17)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon -B22 (A-Type)-\" by [Instrumental] (ep 20)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Rei #23 Version)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (ep 23)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Rei #25 Version)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (ep 25)", "\"Fly Me to the Moon (Rei #26 Version)\" by Megumi Hayashibara (ep 26)"]}
