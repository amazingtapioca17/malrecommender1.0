The individual episodes have their own OPs. The first blast release differed from the main series by having live-action footage of real locations in Japan before delving into the story for each episode. The 2nd had Moguro with the Master interacting with the viewer as if behind the scenes for a studio before delving into each episode. And the 3rd had Moguro and the Master playing outside in the snow as if reporting on an on-location event to the viewer before delving into each episode.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Parent story": [{"mal_id": 3077, "type": "anime", "name": "Warau Salesman", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3077/Warau_Salesman"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 247, "type": "anime", "name": "Shin-Ei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
