However, their vigor irritated their classmate Kasumi who dislikes playing games since she has always been teased by her sister for being bad at them. With a turn of events, it was found out that Kasumi is terrible at English. Thus, she asked her foreign classmate Olivia to help her, but Olivia, who is only born and raised in Japan with foreign parents, can't actually speak English at all! Watch over these three girls' surreal school-life comedy.
