Ten years before the story's opening, strange insect-like creatures known as \"Mushi\" began appearing. The Mushi are able to consume peoples' dreams and thoughts in return for supernatural powers.

However, unbeknownst to Kakkou, Shiika is an escapee from a secret prison known as GARDEN where those posessed by the Mushi, known as the Mushitsuki are held. GARDEN's military force, the Special Environmental Conservation Executive Office, dispatches its finest killer to track down Shiika.
