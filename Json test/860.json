A demon lord is awakened! There are penguins everywhere! What\u2019s going on here? Angel assassin-in-training Flonne is on a quest to destroy the demon Overlord. Instead of accomplishing her mission, the ditzy Flonne manages to wake Laharl, the demon lord and heir to the throne, from his two year slumber. Now the pair, along with Laharl\u2019s not-so-faithful vassal Etna and her army of explosive souls in penguin costumes, must restore order to the crumbling Netherworld. Based on the events of the game Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, Makai Senki Disgaea follows Laharl\u2019s journey to squash the demon rebellion, reclaim the throne, and destroy anyone who stands in his path. Or, you know, let them join him on his travels if they really want. Just remember: Laharl is a demon lord. There\u2019s no way he\u2019ll ever show kindness, compassion, or love... right?", "background": "A preview animation of Makai Senki Disgaea included with the game Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories.", "premiered": "Spring 2006", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 693, "type": "manga", "name": "Makai Senki Disgaea", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/693/Makai_Senki_Disgaea"}], "Other": [{"mal_id": 6741, "type": "anime", "name": "Makai Senki Disgaea: Welcome to Netherworld", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6741/Makai_Senki_Disgaea__Welcome_to_Netherworld"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1623, "type": "anime", "name": "Nippon Ichi Software", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1623/Nippon_Ichi_Software"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Demons", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Demons"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/16/Magic"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Aishitageru\" by LOVERIN TAMBURIN"], "ending_themes": ["\"Kusari\" by Akiko Kawakami"]}
