The anime features sisters Saki and Noriko on a first-time trip to the Holy Land. As the young girls hop on a plane and land in Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion Airport, they hit some of the city's hotspots, and go for a night out on the town. Though punctuated with comedy, the seven-minute installment ends on a dramatic note, with the older one of the two sisters contemplating her relationship, which has recently hit the rocks. The embassy's parrot mascot, dubbed Shalo-um chan, makes a special guest appearance in between scenes, providing little-known facts and tidbits about Israeli life, history and culture. Israel's wine industry as well as its status as the \"Start-up Nation\" are also highlighted in the Japanese-language Anime.
