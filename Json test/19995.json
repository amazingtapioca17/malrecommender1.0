Animage Pocket Data Notes credits MORI Yasuji and KANISHI Takao as either character designers or animation directors of the latter, differing from the credits for the King Kong portion of the show. This was the first cartoon TV series animated entirely in Japan expressly for American television. American sources state Rankin-Bass commissioned the work from Videocraft International; Japanese sources state it was produced by Videocraft/Toei Doga.
