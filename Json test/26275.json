The policies he put into place blocked out Japan for nearly 200 years which eventually caused internal strife and internal war in the Meiji era when Japan opened its borders again only to find it was economically, politically, industrially, scientifically, and culturally behind the rest of the world.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 198, "type": "anime", "name": "Gakken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/198/Gakken"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
