This also meant that they couldn't see Majorika, Lala, and the fairies again. The MAHO-Dou was also deserted and the door to the Majokai was locked. The Queen, having seen all this through her crystal ball, secretly makes it so that Doremi and co. all end up heading into the Majokai again, with the excuse to return Majorika's hair dryer. However they end up stumbling into a garden, and one of the roses reveals a baby! The Queen tells the girls that they must raise the baby for a whole year. To help them, they receive newer and stronger witch powers than before! The adventure isn't over yet!", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2000", "broadcast": "Sundays at 08:30 (JST)", "related": {"Prequel": [{"mal_id": 350, "type": "anime", "name": "Ojamajo Doremi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/350/Ojamajo_Doremi"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 352, "type": "anime", "name": "Motto!
