At the top of this list is the beautiful Haruka Nogizaka, an intelligent and wealthy girl who comes from a prestigious family, and is by far the most idolized girl at school. Her popularity is so great that her classmates occasionally give her French nicknames to further express their infatuation. Yuuto Ayase is a timid boy who has the unbelievable luck of sitting in class with Haruka every day. Like many others, he admires her from a distance, never even dreaming of approaching her. But with a sudden twist of fate, Yuuto's random visit to the school library brings Haruka's darkest secret to light, one which could potentially destroy her current reputation of elegance. As it turns out, the school's most beloved princess is actually a huge otaku. This revelation marks the beginning of a beautiful friendship between these two classmates.", "background": null, "premiered": "Summer 2008", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 9072, "type": "manga", "name": "Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/9072/Nogizaka_Haruka_no_Himitsu"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 6023, "type": "anime", "name": "Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6023/Nogizaka_Haruka_no_Himitsu__Purezza"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Universal Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/31/Geneon_Universal_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 681, "type": "anime", "name": "ASCII Media Works", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/681/ASCII_Media_Works"}, {"mal_id": 719, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Mausu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/719/Studio_Mausu"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 467, "type": "anime", "name": "Discotek Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/467/Discotek_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 51, "type": "anime", "name": "Diomedea", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/51/Diomedea"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Tomadoi Bitter Tune (\u3068\u307e\u3069\u3044\u30d3\u30bf\u30fc\u30c1\u30e5\u30fc\u30f3)\" by Miran Himemiya and Chocolate Rockers"], "ending_themes": ["\"Hitosashiyubi Quiet!
