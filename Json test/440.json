The prince left Utena only with a ring bearing a strange rose crest and a promise that she would meet him again some day. A few years later, Utena attends Ootori Academy, where she is drawn into a dangerous game. Duelists with rings matching Utena's own compete for a unique prize: the Rose Bride, Anthy Himemiya, and her mysterious powers. When Utena wins Anthy in a duel, she realizes that if she is to free Anthy and discover the secrets behind Ootori Academy, she has only one option: to revolutionize the world. Shoujo Kakumei Utena blends surrealist imagery and ideas with complex allegories and metaphors to create a unique coming-of-age story with themes including idealism, illusions, adulthood, and identity. [Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Childhood idealism, illusions, ambition, adulthood, sexuality, abuse, incest and identity are all prominent themes which are explored in what is essentially a highly metaphorical and symbolic coming-of-age story. Loss of innocence, both sexual and otherwise, is treated as a life changing event. Fairy tale archetypes such as the noble prince and the damsel in distress, as well as standard tropes of the shoujo and magical girl genre are incorporated, subverted, inverted, averted and deconstructed.Shoujo Kakumei Utena won the Best TV Animation Award at Animation Kobe in 1997.", "premiered": "Spring 1997", "broadcast": "Wednesdays at 18:00 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 772, "type": "manga", "name": "Shoujo Kakumei Utena", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/772/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 441, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Adolescence Mokushiroku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/441/Shoujo_Kakumei_Utena__Adolescence_Mokushiroku"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 1461, "type": "anime", "name": "Audio Tanaka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1461/Audio_Tanaka"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 284, "type": "anime", "name": "Central Park Media", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/284/Central_Park_Media"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}, {"mal_id": 40, "type": "anime", "name": "Psychological", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/40/Psychological"}, {"mal_id": 25, "type": "anime", "name": "Shoujo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/25/Shoujo"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Rinbu Revolution\" by Masami Okui"], "ending_themes": ["\"Truth\" by Luca Yumi (eps 1-24)", "\"\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u767a\u751f\u5b66 (Virtual Star Hasseigaku)\" by Maki Kamiya (eps 25-38)", "\"Rose & release\" by Masami Okui (ep 39)"]}
