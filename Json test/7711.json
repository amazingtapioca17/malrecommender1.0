For Arrietty, though, the only real fear in life is in missing out on a big adventure. 14-year-old Arrietty and her parents live in the small spaces of a human garden. They are what some might call \u201cborrowers\u201d; they take items from the human world to eke out a living amidst the shadows. Their existence goes mostly undiscovered until the arrival of 12-year-old Shou. When Shou begins to notice small things going missing, he becomes suspicious. He soon meets Arrietty and strikes up a friendship that neither of them could have seen coming. However, this is a friendship fraught with danger due to the obvious risk of Arrietty and her family\u2019s discovery, something that could send the borrowers right into the hands of those that would do them harm. In Karigurashi no Arrietty, Studio Ghibli presents audiences with a beautiful look at the human world... from a much smaller perspective.", "background": "Karigurashi no Arrietty is Studio Ghibli\u2019s re-imagining of Mary Norton\u2019s 1952 novel, \u201cThe Borrowers.\u201d The film won 5 Tokyo Anime Awards in 2011 for the following categories: Animation of the Year, Best Art Direction, Best Director, Best Music, and Notable Entry.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 417, "type": "anime", "name": "Walt Disney Studios", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Walt_Disney_Studios"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": ["\"The Neglected Garden\" by C\u00e9cile Corbel"], "ending_themes": ["\"Arrietty's song\" by C\u00e9cile Corbel"]}
