Unfortunately for Riki, he`s the doppleganger in our world of Byoudo, Master of the Dark Realm, and when a dimensional gate opens between the two worlds, the evil Fairy Master tricks Byoudo into making an attempt to conquer our beautiful, and better lit, world. Now poor Riki is semi-possessed by his opposite numbed, and the minions of the Fairy Master are mutating his classmates into hideous lustful monsters. To make matters worse, all the inter-dimensional commotion has attracted the attention of a sword-happy exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police! Which all means that Riki is about to take one bitch of a mid-term. The course is survival, and forget \"Pass/Fail\". The test is graded \"Live/Die\".", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 382, "type": "anime", "name": "Tokuma Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/382/Tokuma_Shoten"}, {"mal_id": 567, "type": "anime", "name": "D.A.S.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/567/DAST"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 310, "type": "anime", "name": "AnimEigo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/310/AnimEigo"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Horror", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/14/Horror"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}, {"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Demons", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Demons"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Medusa\" by Yuuri Sugimoto"]}
