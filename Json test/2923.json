Each egg eventually hatches into a Guardian Character: Ran, Miki, and Su.

The Guardian Characters accomplish this by giving encouragement and advice, but they can also temporarily change a person's personality and abilities. With the Guardian Characters, Amu's life becomes much more complex as she now struggles to deal with her new personalities and the Seiyo Elementary Guardians\u2014a student council group where each member has their own Guardian Character\u2014who recruits Amu to search for and seal the X eggs and X Characters, corrupted forms of people's dreams.", "background": null, "premiered": "Fall 2007", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 101, "type": "manga", "name": "Shugo Chara!", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/101/Shugo_Chara"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 5262, "type": "anime", "name": "Shugo Chara!!
