In the middle of a battle between Dr. Yung's Mirage Pok\u00e9mon and Ash, the machine goes haywire and a Mirage Aerodactyl swoops in and kidnaps Dr. Yung. A man calling himself \"The Mirage Master\" appears and announces to everyone that the Mirage System can be used to create Pok\u00e9mon with absolutely no weaknesses.
