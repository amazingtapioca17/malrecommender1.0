Together with his cousin, Mako (whom he has a crush on), Ichiro, and Pandaikon (a panda he found in his yard that resembles a daikon), they strive to make money any way they can, and in the process, rid the world of evil-doers and steal their money in the process. With help from a rental guy, Nabeshin, who rents them outrageous items that always seem to help them defeat the bad guys, the Nerima Daikon Brothers sing their way to victory but always manage to lose the money they stole in the end. Even under the investigation of Inspector Karakuri, they never fail to fight for justice the Nerima-Daikon way.", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2006", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 12266, "type": "manga", "name": "Nerima Daikon Brothers", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/12266/Nerima_Daikon_Brothers"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Aniplex", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/17/Aniplex"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}, {"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 101, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Hibari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/101/Studio_Hibari"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Ma-Ji-Ya-Ba\" by Nerima Daikon Brothers"], "ending_themes": ["\"Berima!\" by Nerima Daikon Brothers"]}
