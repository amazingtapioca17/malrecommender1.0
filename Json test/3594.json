Riannon's brother, First Warrior Arthur, rescues her, when Arawn suddenly materializes before them as a handsome grey-haired man. Hiding his true identity and remaining enigmatic, Arawn pledges his power and leadership to the tribe's cause and joins Arthur, Riannon, and their merry band of friends\u2014including a talented swordsman, an agile hunter, and a group of ecstatic pixies\u2014as they fight back against the Empire, while uncovering the dark secrets of the land along the way.
