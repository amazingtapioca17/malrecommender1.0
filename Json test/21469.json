One day he is approached by Sewashi Nobi, the great-great-grandson of Nobi Nobita. Sewashi demands of Doraemon to go back to the past and make Nobita happy in order to prevent a disastrous and bleak future. Doraemon is not excited about this idea, but Sewashi installs a program into Doraemon and eventually sends him back to the past. Nobita Nobi is an elementary school boy who is very lazy, unlucky and a scaredy-cat. He gets bullied by everyone and does not excel in any school subject. When he meets Doraemon for the first time, the two of them start off on the wrong foot; however, they soon become great friends. Doraemon cannot go home to the 22nd century unless he turns Nobita into a boy who can stand on his own and be happy.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1032, "type": "manga", "name": "Doraemon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1032/Doraemon"}], "Parent story": [{"mal_id": 8687, "type": "anime", "name": "Doraemon (2005)", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/8687/Doraemon_2005"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 245, "type": "anime", "name": "Toho", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/245/Toho"}, {"mal_id": 249, "type": "anime", "name": "Robot Communications", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/249/Robot_Communications"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 235, "type": "anime", "name": "Shirogumi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/235/Shirogumi"}, {"mal_id": 247, "type": "anime", "name": "Shin-Ei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Himawari no Yakusoku (\u3072\u307e\u308f\u308a\u306e\u7d04\u675f)\" by Motohiro Hata"]}
