Space differs from the rest of the Once Upon a Time titles in the sense that the series revolve on a dramatic content rather than an educational premise. The series still has a handful of educational information (such as an episode discussing the rings of Planet Saturn). The series succeeds Once Upon a Time... Man. It reprises almost the entire totality of the characters of the previous series and adapts them into a science-fiction context. The story tells about the confrontation of many big galactic powers. Among them there is the Omega Confederation, of which Earth is a member of; the military republic of Cassiop\u00e9e led by the general Le Teigneux; and a powerful supercomputer which controls an army of robots. Once Upon a Time... Space features the adventures of Pierrot (son of colonel Pierre and president Pierrette) and his friend Psi.", "background": null, "premiered": "?", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Other": [{"mal_id": 3624, "type": "anime", "name": "Seimei no Kagaku: Micro Patrol", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3624/Seimei_no_Kagaku__Micro_Patrol"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 169, "type": "anime", "name": "Fuji TV", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/169/Fuji_TV"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 191, "type": "anime", "name": "Eiken", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/191/Eiken"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 29, "type": "anime", "name": "Space", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/29/Space"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Ashita no Ginga e (\u3042\u3057\u305f\u306e\u9280\u6cb3\u3078)\" by \u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30d6\u30fc", "\"Ginga no Joou (\u9280\u6cb3\u306e\u5973\u738b)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"], "ending_themes": ["\"Ai no Mori (\u611b\u306e\u68ee)\" by \u30d4\u30fc\u30ab\u30d6\u30fc", "\"Yoake no Prelude (\u591c\u660e\u3051\u306e\u30d7\u30ec\u30ea\u30e5\u30fc\u30c9)\" by Tatsuya Matsuno"]}
