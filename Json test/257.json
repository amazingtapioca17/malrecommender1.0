Among the students of these schools are a select few who are in possession of sacred beads. These magatama harbor the souls of warriors who fought during the Three Kingdoms Era of Chinese history. Not only are these students blessed with abilities that draw from the souls they are tied to, but they are also blessed, or maybe cursed, with the fates of these warriors from the past. One of these students is Hakufu Sonsaku; a young, caring, dim-witted girl who has recently transferred into Nanyo Academy and will be living with her cousin, Koukin Shuyu. Hakufu\u2019s arrival creates an almost immediate sense of tension due to her power as a fighter and the possibility that she may be the one who carries the spirit of the Chinese warlord, Sun Ce. The most powerful fighters at Nanyo, known as \u201cThe Big Four\u201d are shaken by her presence and determined to stop Hakufu from achieving the goal given to her by her mother: to conquer those who challenge her and unite the seven schools.", "background": "Ikkitousen draws heavily from the famous Chinese novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The souls that inhabit the sacred beads are drawn from actual historical figures, though some elements have been changed for dramatic license. The series was originally licensed by Geneon Entertainment in the United States but was picked up by FUNimation when Geneon ceased their US anime operations in late 2007.", "premiered": "Summer 2003", "broadcast": "Wednesdays at 11:30 (JST)", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 372, "type": "manga", "name": "Ikkitousen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/372/Ikkitousen"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 1956, "type": "anime", "name": "Ikkitousen: Dragon Destiny", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1956/Ikkitousen__Dragon_Destiny"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 79, "type": "anime", "name": "Genco", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/79/Genco"}, {"mal_id": 745, "type": "anime", "name": "Cosmic Ray", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/745/Cosmic_Ray"}, {"mal_id": 759, "type": "anime", "name": "Eye Move", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/759/Eye_Move"}, {"mal_id": 775, "type": "anime", "name": "Bushiroad", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/775/Bushiroad"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}, {"mal_id": 17, "type": "anime", "name": "Martial Arts", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/17/Martial_Arts"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Drivin' through the Night\" by move"], "ending_themes": ["\"Let me be with You\" by Shela"]}
