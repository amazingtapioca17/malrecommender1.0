Somehow, he has been sent to Edo Period Japan. In Edo Japan, a villain called Shuten Douji (\u6731\u5929\u7ae5\u5b50) is threatening to destroy the Earth if he is not given Princess Mari. Always willing to impress a pretty girl, Kinnikuman immediately vows to destroy Shuten Doji. He disguises himself as Princess Mari and goes to meet Shuten Doji, but Shuten Doji and his Big Four (\u56db\u5929\u738b, Shitennou) see through Kinnikuman's disguise and beat him up. Aware of Kinnikuman's situation, Terryman, Robin Mask, and the other Seigi Choujins travel to Edo Japan (via Kinkotsu-obaba's powers). (Source: Kinnikuman Wiki)", "background": "Hour of Triumph!
