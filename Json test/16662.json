Kaze Tachinu is the story of the man who created the Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter, the most famous airplane in Japanese history. From his childhood in Fujioka, Jirou dreamed of designing flying machines like his hero, Italian aviation pioneer Giovanni Battista Caproni. Through disaster, romance, war and loss, Jirou continues to chase that dream - learning along the way that once released into the world, dreams can take on a very different shape.", "background": "Before its release, director Miyazaki Hayao declared that Kaze Tachinu would be his final film. Like most of Miyazaki's films, it was the top-grossing movie of its release year, earning $113 million in the domestic box office in 2013. The film was controversial on both sides of the political spectrum because of its sympathetic portrayal of Horikoshi and its perceived anti-war stance. The film was nominated for an Academy Award, Miyazaki's third nomination. \r\nThe film has won several awards. In 2013 it won the Best Animated Feature during the Alliance of Women Film Journalists, during the New York Film Critics Online, during the Online Film Critics Society, during the San Francisco Film Critics Circle and during the Toronto Film Critics Association. Also in 2013 it won the Best Animated Film during the Boston Online Film Critics Association (which tied with Frozen), during the Boston Society of Film Critics, during the Chicago Film Critics Association, during the New York Film Critics Circle and during the San Diego Film Critics Society. During the same year it won the Audience Favorite \u2013 Animation during the Mill Valley Film Festival and the Best Family Film during the Women Film Critics Circle. In 2014 it won the Animation of the Year during the Japan Academy Prize, the Best Animated Film during the National Board of Review and the Best Motion Picture, Animated or Mixed Media during the Satellite Awards.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 46318, "type": "manga", "name": "Kaze Tachinu: Miyazaki Hayao no Mousou Comeback", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/46318/Kaze_Tachinu__Miyazaki_Hayao_no_Mousou_Comeback"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 1585, "type": "anime", "name": "Nichion", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1585/Nichion"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 417, "type": "anime", "name": "Walt Disney Studios", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Walt_Disney_Studios"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Hikouki Gumo (\u3072\u3053\u3046\u304d\u96f2) by Yumi Matsutoya"]}
