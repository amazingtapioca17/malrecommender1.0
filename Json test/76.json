The ferret turned out to be Yuuno, an archeologist and mage from another world who had accidentally scattered the dangerous Jewel Seeds throughout Earth. Without the strength to collect the Jewel Seeds, Yuuno had resumed a ferret form and needed someone else to take on the task for him. He gave a red jewel to Nanoha explaining to her with this she could transform and use magic to combat the monsters that threatened them due to the Jewel Seeds. But the monsters are the least of their worries, as Yuuno and Nanoha are not the only ones out to collect the Jewel Seeds.", "background": null, "premiered": "Fall 2004", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 23223, "type": "manga", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/23223/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 77, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha A's", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/77/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha_As"}], "Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 176, "type": "anime", "name": "Triangle Heart: Sweet Songs Forever", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/176/Triangle_Heart__Sweet_Songs_Forever"}], "Alternative version": [{"mal_id": 4985, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4985/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__The_Movie_1st"}, {"mal_id": 12101, "type": "anime", "name": "Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: Lyrical Toy Box", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12101/Mahou_Shoujo_Lyrical_Nanoha__Lyrical_Toy_Box"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 92, "type": "anime", "name": "Starchild Records", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/92/Starchild_Records"}, {"mal_id": 313, "type": "anime", "name": "Omnibus Japan", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/313/Omnibus_Japan"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 1459, "type": "anime", "name": "Geneon Entertainment USA", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1459/Geneon_Entertainment_USA"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Seven Arcs", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/35/Seven_Arcs"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "Magic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/16/Magic"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Innocent Starter\" by Nana Mizuki"], "ending_themes": ["\"Little Wish ~lyrical step~\" by Tamura Yukari"]}
