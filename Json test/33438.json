Stewed, saut\u00e9ed, or squeezed. In an alternate world, the Japanese corporation Flesh Inc. has managed to create zombies on domestic soil during the roaring Sixties (the years of the economic boom) using voodoo techniques imported from Africa, and it has built a fortune thereafter by selling zombie products of all kind: instant noodles, soft drinks, hamburgers, pet food, and cosmetics. But when a trio of self-centered millennials on their first workday get trapped inside a fully automated zombie farm with their old-school technotard supervisor and a horde of undead running amok, overcoming generation gaps becomes a matter of survival. (Source: Production I.G)", "background": "An irreverent and over-the-top social commentary on too many exotic yet ambiguous ingredients that are marketed in all possible ways by the food industry, Walking Meat also humorously portrays the ultimate generational clash between digital natives and analogue-style post-war samurai workers. The short film marks the directorial debut of CG creator Shinya Sugai.Walking Meat was tentatively titled Zombie when it was first announced as part of the now-abandoned Force of Will the Movie project. The short film made its premiere at the Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival in July 2018 before being screened in Japan two months later at Anime Technic Sessions Unlimited for Creators.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1892, "type": "anime", "name": "Sublimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1892/Sublimation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
