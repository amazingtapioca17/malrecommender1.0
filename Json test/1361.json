Deadly alien creatures known as Phantoms have appeared all over the planet, and mere contact with these entities is lethal, whether it be an instant death or a prolonged decline. In order to try and salvage what little of the human race is left, large force-field barriers have been constructed around certain cities to repel the Phantoms. Seeking a more permanent solution to this invasion are scientists Aki Ross and her mentor, Dr. Sid, whose investigations have revealed that there exists a form of spiritual, Gaia energy that can eradicate the Phantom's presence from this world. Aki and Sid aren't alone in their quest through Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within; the human council and the military squad \"Deep Eyes\" are ready to help. Not everyone is convinced of this plan though. Aki, Sid, Grey, and their allies have to band together against forces both alien and human if they are to have any chance at restoring peace to Earth. An enemy whose mere touch is fatal, the Phantoms appear the more dangerous enemy, but as they will come to find out, their human nemeses are also not to be trifled with.", "background": "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was the only full length film produced by Square Pictures. The movie's final budget was $137 million dollar budget, due to the high costs of the technology being used for the film's computer animation. With marketing costs included, The Spirits Within lost in excess of $94 million. Adjusted for 2016 inflation, this amounts to over $126 million. Not only did this directly lead to the closing of Square Pictures, but it also delayed the parent company Square from completing its planned merger with the video game publishing company Enix.\r\nA Japanese/American collaboration, The Spirits Within was filmed in English and premiered in the United States two months before releasing in Japan.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 757, "type": "anime", "name": "Sony Music Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/757/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 58, "type": "anime", "name": "Square Enix", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/58/Square_Enix"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Spirit Dreams Inside\" by L'Arc-en-Ciel"], "ending_themes": ["\"The Dream Within\" by Lara Fabian"]}
