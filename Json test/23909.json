Takeshi discovers that the crane is really a talking spaceship that takes him and his friends to visit a fairground in the stars. A girl falls through a hole into Space Hell, and the children cooperate to rescue her. Takeshi wakes up, wondering if it was all a dream. The next day, he returns the magic crane to its rightful owner. This tale is from Rainbow Across the Pacific's Daisuke Ikeda, the leader of the buddhist Soka Gakkai organization which is commonly considered a cult as it is a part of the shinshuukyou religious movement.
