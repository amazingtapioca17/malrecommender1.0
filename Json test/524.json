Therefore he decides to head out in the woods and set up a camp, where he can be work in peace. But, as always, we have Morino who is up to no good. To make things a bit more interesting, she organizes a field trip to Maiku's camp site, and encourages everyone to make some good summer memories.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 195, "type": "anime", "name": "Onegai\u2606Teacher", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/195/Onegai\u2606Teacher"}, {"mal_id": 443, "type": "anime", "name": "Onegai\u2606Teacher: Himitsu na Futari", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/443/Onegai\u2606Teacher__Himitsu_na_Futari"}], "Parent story": [{"mal_id": 196, "type": "anime", "name": "Onegai\u2606Twins", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/196/Onegai\u2606Twins"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Visual", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/23/Bandai_Visual"}, {"mal_id": 33, "type": "anime", "name": "WOWOW", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/33/WOWOW"}, {"mal_id": 104, "type": "anime", "name": "Lantis", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/104/Lantis"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 217, "type": "anime", "name": "Nozomi Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/217/Nozomi_Entertainment"}, {"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 39, "type": "anime", "name": "Daume", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/39/Daume"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Second Flight\" by KOTOKO & Hiromi Sato"], "ending_themes": ["\"Asu e no Namida\" by Mami Kawada"]}
