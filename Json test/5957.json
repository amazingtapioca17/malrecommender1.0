But Churuya isn't aware of this evil plot, thus she maintains the effort for the sake of cheese. Each day is a struggle to get the beloved smoked cheese, but it's much harder than she could ever imagine!", "background": "This spin-off won the Network Award at the 14th Animation Kobe Awards, along with Suzumiya Haruhi-chan no Yuuutsu.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 18139, "type": "manga", "name": "Nyoro-n Churuya-san", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/18139/Nyoro-n_Churuya-san"}], "Spin-off": [{"mal_id": 849, "type": "anime", "name": "Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 113, "type": "anime", "name": "Kadokawa Shoten", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/113/Kadokawa_Shoten"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 102, "type": "anime", "name": "Funimation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/102/Funimation"}, {"mal_id": 233, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/233/Bandai_Entertainment"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Kyoto Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/2/Kyoto_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
