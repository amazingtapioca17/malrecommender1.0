Meanwhile, Shirou's friends\u2014Tooka Yatogami, Yoshino, and Kotori Itsuka\u2014are looking for him, while also enjoying the festival themselves. As Shidou spends the day with Kurumi, he begins to notice an unexpected softer side of her. He knows that Kurumi is infamously called the \"Worst Spirit,\" but the girl standing before him is a gentle soul. However, as the day draws to a close, Shirou finally begins to understand the truth behind it all.
