Using the \u039e Gundam Mafty attempts to attack a meeting of high-ranking Federation cabinet members in Adelaide, Australia to force them to vote down a provision which would strengthen the Federations already considerable powers. As a point to note, this novel focuses on a version of events chronicled in creator Yoshiyuki Tomino's novelized form of Char's Counterattack, rather than his animated movie version, and as such, several discrepancies can be found between the animated work and this novel, making it more of a semi-canonical UC storyline, rather than 100% official canon.
