Crazed faculty members with homicidal and perverted tendencies, violent and unfriendly classmates, all of them welcome Kukunosuke to her new home. Pretty soon, it's an all-out teacher vs. students war. Will she be able to finish school before school finishes her?", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 7756, "type": "manga", "name": "Abashiri Ikka", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/7756/Abashiri_Ikka"}], "Other": [{"mal_id": 4923, "type": "anime", "name": "Akai Hayate", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4923/Akai_Hayate"}, {"mal_id": 12769, "type": "anime", "name": "Yumemakura Baku Twilight Gekijou", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12769/Yumemakura_Baku_Twilight_Gekijou"}, {"mal_id": 20385, "type": "anime", "name": "Eguchi Hisashi no Kotobuki Gorou Show", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/20385/Eguchi_Hisashi_no_Kotobuki_Gorou_Show"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 921, "type": "anime", "name": "Dynamic Planning", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/921/Dynamic_Planning"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Pierrot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Studio_Pierrot"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "opening_themes": ["''Yasashiku Nankanai!'' by Tonguu Kyouko"], "ending_themes": []}
