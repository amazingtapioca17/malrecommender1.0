Despite the enmity between the races, a lighthearted witch named Zero enlists a beastfallen whom she refers to as \"Mercenary\" to act as her protector. He travels with Zero and Albus, a young magician, on their search for the Grimoire of Zero: a powerful spell book that could be extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.
