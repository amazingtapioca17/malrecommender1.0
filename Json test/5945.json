Chemical elements such as oxygen, carbon, gold, molybdenum, and cobalt disappeared from the earth's crust suddenly. The human population was decreased by 90% in sixty years. Researchers found out that the disappeared elements were drained into a planet \"Nega Earth\", located in another dimension. To save the Earth, a special team called the \"Element Hunters\" is organized. All of the members are under 13 years old, because young and flexible brains are needed to access \"Nega Earth\".", "background": null, "premiered": "Summer 2009", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 18:00 (JST)", "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 111, "type": "anime", "name": "NHK", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/111/NHK"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 367, "type": "anime", "name": "Heewon Entertainment", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/367/Heewon_Entertainment"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "opening_themes": ["\"First Pain\" by Chiaki Ishikawa"], "ending_themes": ["\"Suihe Liebe ~Mahou no Jumon~\" by Kakki & Ash Potato"]}
