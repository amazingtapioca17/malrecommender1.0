Her character was signed on by the Avex Inc. as a musician for a radio program on August 23, 2018. This is the official music video created under the company's label. Avex stated on their official YouTube channel that if Ao doesn't get 1 million views, they will drop her from the radio program. (Source: Avex's Official YouTube channel) NOTE FOR MODS: she's just like Kizuna Ai. But only this music video was done under a real large company and real record label Avex. So I'm submitting it. They are treating Ao as a human. So even though this MV is a legit anime same as all the other Avex MVs, that doesn't mean Ao's entire virtualtuber work history is anime since Avex only signed her in August and she's been around since February. Mainly because we still don't know who worked on what. An entire professional team might have worked on doing the music video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuemLv9DNG4 since it's a legitimate concert and has Avex's name attached; part of the contract might stipulate the usage of her 3D model from the original creators for Avex to use solely for Avex projects. Or the original creators did it for Avex. We just don't know, no credits are given anywhere and the staff working on her yt channel are kept a secret....as with most virtual youtubers. Anyway, I thought this was the best compromise to be able to add a professional MV while excluding all that virtual youtuber garbage.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 19, "type": "anime", "name": "Music", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/19/Music"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
