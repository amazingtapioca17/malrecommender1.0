A friendly guy says that it is a typical Alpine village with the glamour of Paris and the atmosphere of Venice... Is it, really?! OK. Let's take a closer look... Oh, my goodness! The village looks as if it is made of sushi tools - The banks of the canals are sushi pails. The buildings are piled-up sushi baskets etc...

They are also educational and entertaining describing friendship and kindness. So, please enjoy the mind-healing tales in this fantasy land.
