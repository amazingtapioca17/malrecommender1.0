A story of a child who has been inheriting a negative legacy of humankind that continuously accumulates in diverse ways. The child keeps carrying the legacy, that is too heavy and too much to bear for her body, feverishly without knowing the real meaning of the act. Soon, the child starts to act out a vision of knowledge, prayers, courage and curiosity. She realizes that positive power is the best balance towards purification and she should stop carrying on the negativity through a negative attitude.
