Then again, neither is Duke Togo, Tadashi Togo, or any number of the aliases he goes by. A man of mystery, not even the world\u2019s most prominent intelligence agencies can determine who Golgo really is, or just where he came from. But all agree that his skills are nothing short of legendary. Armed with a custom M16, Golgo is willing to take any job for any agency, from the FBI to the KGB. He has completed every contract he has ever taken and will work for anyone who can meet his price. He is both the greatest weapon and the greatest threat to any nation; no one is safe once they are in Golgo\u2019s sights.", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2008", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1298, "type": "manga", "name": "Golgo 13", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1298/Golgo_13"}], "Prequel": [{"mal_id": 1760, "type": "anime", "name": "Golgo 13", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1760/Golgo_13"}, {"mal_id": 1761, "type": "anime", "name": "Golgo 13: Queen Bee", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1761/Golgo_13__Queen_Bee"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 16, "type": "anime", "name": "TV Tokyo", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/16/TV_Tokyo"}, {"mal_id": 64, "type": "anime", "name": "Sotsu", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/64/Sotsu"}, {"mal_id": 213, "type": "anime", "name": "Half H.P Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/213/Half_HP_Studio"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 376, "type": "anime", "name": "Sentai Filmworks", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/376/Sentai_Filmworks"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 229, "type": "anime", "name": "The Answer Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/229/The_Answer_Studio"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 41, "type": "anime", "name": "Thriller", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/41/Thriller"}, {"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Take the Wave\" by Naifu (eps 1-25)", "\"So Faraway\" by Pinc Inc.
