One day Eiji finds a mysterious book called the \"Pikachin Research Book,\" and learns about the seven tools that make up the Pikachin Kit. Eiji presses a button inside the research book, and immediately a \"Future Amazon\" delivery arrives at his door with the kit. Eiji uses the blueprints included in the box to assemble the kit, but it seems as though 1% part of the kit is still missing. In the franchise, the word \"Pikachin\" means the flash of inspiration or insight one gets about a new project, similar to the visual of a lightbulb turning on above one's head when someone has an idea. The concept of the franchise is \"invention is 99% plastic models, 1% inspiration.\" (Source: ANN)", "background": null, "premiered": "Winter 2018", "broadcast": "Saturdays at 09:30 (JST)", "related": {"Prequel": [{"mal_id": 36947, "type": "anime", "name": "Pochitto Hatsumei: Pikachin-Kit", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/36947/Pochitto_Hatsumei__Pikachin-Kit"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 230, "type": "anime", "name": "Bandai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/230/Bandai"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 28, "type": "anime", "name": "OLM", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/28/OLM"}, {"mal_id": 247, "type": "anime", "name": "Shin-Ei Animation", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/247/Shin-Ei_Animation"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 15, "type": "anime", "name": "Kids", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/15/Kids"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Poka\u2606Chin Time (\u30d4\u30ab\u2606\u3061\u3093\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0)\" by Hajime Akira to Tsukumo-chan (Ichirou Itou & Shion Miyawaki) (\u306f\u3058\u3081\u3042\u304d\u3089\u3068\u3064\u304f\u3082\u3061\u3083\u3093\uff08\u4f0a\u85e4\u4e00\u6717\u3068\u5bae\u8107\u8a69\u97f3\uff09)"], "ending_themes": ["\"Dracaena (\u30c9\u30e9\u30bb\u30ca)\" by Ai Otsuka"]}
