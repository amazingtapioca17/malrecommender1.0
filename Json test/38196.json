It carried out the deadly Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995 and was found to have been responsible for another smaller sarin attack the previous year. The cult created its own studio called MAT (Manga, Animation, and Team) in 1991 for the sole purpose of recruiting otaku into their cult. This 10 episode OVA mostly focuses around Asahara himself being Christ. All 10 episodes were sold separately during its initial release but a compilation is available on the cult's official YouTube channel. NOTE FOR MODS: can we get a new studio listing called MAT for this. They've made a bunch of OVAs for the cult. The studio does manga too and they've also published several manga that was sold in bookstores which you can buy online as well https://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/WO10825", "background": "Asahara was executed on July 6, 2018 along with other members for commuting murder and terrorist attacks.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
