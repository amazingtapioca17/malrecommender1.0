In Japan, this arrangement was given Japanese lyrics and introduced as \"Amaryllis\" on NHK's Minna no Uta series in 1968. The tune has since become well known as a French folk song there and its melody can be heard today as a chime signaling the hour over the PA systems of some schools and rural municipalities.
