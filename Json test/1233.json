Both Haneda and Mitaka do not get along with each other, and their rivalry worsens when they both fall for Isurugi. But with the entire JASDF having doubts about the team, the Airbats must work as a team or face total disbandment.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 20392, "type": "manga", "name": "Aozora Shoujotai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/20392/Aozora_Shoujotai"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Fantasia", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/24/Studio_Fantasia"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 97, "type": "anime", "name": "ADV Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/97/ADV_Films"}], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Niji ni Naritai (I Wanna Be a Rainbow)\" by Mayaka"], "ending_themes": ["\"Taiyou ga Atatameta Kimochi (The Sun Warms My Heart)\" by Aya Hisakawa and Ai Orikasa (eps 1-3)", "\"Fuchu Shigure (A Light Rain in Fuchu)\" by Kikuko Inoue (ep 4)", "\"Love Letter in the Blue Sky\" by Yukana Nogami (eps 5-7)"]}
