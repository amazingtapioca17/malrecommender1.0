After having been unboxed, they discover themselves in a toy shop where they befriend a toy elephant and toy seal. After falling from a counter and becoming broken, they are thrown in the trash. Outside, they become enslaved by Manny the Rat, who runs a casino in the city dump and uses broken wind-up toys as his slave labor force. With the aid of a psychic frog, the mice escape and meet various animal characters on a quest of becoming free and independent \"self-winding\" toys. They rediscover the elephant and seal, who are somewhat broken down, and manage to form a family and destroy the rat empire.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 150, "type": "anime", "name": "Sanrio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/150/Sanrio"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": []}
