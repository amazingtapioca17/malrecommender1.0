For some reason, he keeps attracting the attention (and affections) of animal spirits! Having spent most of his life in the country, Kouta is understandably nervous when he moves in with his grandma to attend a high school in the big city. He hoped to make a good impression, but having Chizuru, a beautiful fox spirit, hanging off his arm didn't seem to be the sort of image he wanted to have. She's not alone in her love for Kouta, either. Nozomu, a wolf spirit, as well as other youkai have their sights set on the hapless country boy.", "background": "Kanokon adapts the first 6 novels of Katsumi Nishino's light novel series of the same title.", "premiered": "Spring 2008", "broadcast": "Unknown", "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1687, "type": "manga", "name": "Kanokon", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1687/Kanokon"}], "Side story": [{"mal_id": 4760, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanokon Specials", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/4760/Kanokon_Specials"}], "Sequel": [{"mal_id": 6791, "type": "anime", "name": "Kanokon: Manatsu no Dai Shanikusai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/6791/Kanokon__Manatsu_no_Dai_Shanikusai"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 108, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Factory", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/108/Media_Factory"}, {"mal_id": 166, "type": "anime", "name": "Movic", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/166/Movic"}, {"mal_id": 238, "type": "anime", "name": "AT-X", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/238/AT-X"}], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 250, "type": "anime", "name": "Media Blasters", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/250/Media_Blasters"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}, {"mal_id": 35, "type": "anime", "name": "Harem", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/35/Harem"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}, {"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}, {"mal_id": 36, "type": "anime", "name": "Slice of Life", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/36/Slice_of_Life"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "opening_themes": ["\"PHOSPHOR\" by Ui Miyazaki"], "ending_themes": ["\"Koi no Honoo (\u604b\u306e\u708e)\" by Yui Sakakibara"]}
