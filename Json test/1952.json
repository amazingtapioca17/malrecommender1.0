Zombies, vampires, werewolves - all of them compete in contests of strength and sheer will to attain their own personal goals. All of this becomes moot when a race of Aztec robots called the Huitzil decide that humanity isn't worth saving, and start waging war on the world, while in the sky, a solar god from outer space plots the conquest of Earth. And the Darkstalkers must become unwilling allies in order to save the world.
