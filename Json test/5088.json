This animation series is inspired by \"the Diary of Insects\" written by Jean Henri Fabre, an outstanding French entomologist and author in the 19th Century. In his original works, Mr. Fabre vividly described the life of insects. In this series all the insects and bugs have been personified and drawn into marvelous animated characters. This is the story of the exciting adventures of a crime-buster in the world of insects! Our hero's way of investigation is so unique and always ends with surprising solutions. The interesting ecology of various insects will be described while our \"cool\" hero, Inspector Fabre, analyzes and unties the knots of crimes and conspiracy a la fashion of Sherlock Holmes!", "background": null, "premiered": "Spring 2000", "broadcast": "Tuesdays at 18:30 (JST)", "related": [], "producers": [{"mal_id": 311, "type": "anime", "name": "Enoki Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/311/Enoki_Films"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [{"mal_id": 154, "type": "anime", "name": "E&G Films", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/154/E_G_Films"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "opening_themes": ["\"Mayoeru Tenshi-tachi (\u8ff7\u3048\u308b\u5929\u4f7f\u305f\u3061)\" by MELODY"], "ending_themes": ["\"Giniro no \u00c9toile (\u9280\u8272\u306e\u30a8\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb)\" by SUS4"]}
