With the sound of fireworks at the core, this explosive single was composed by Hifana and is a fresh sonic expression of a Japanese summer matsuri (festival), filtered through Hifana's signature Tokyo-born Japanese hybrid breakbeats. The video, co-directed by Fantasista Utamaro and Shane Lester, is another potent expression of Hifana's unique mixing of the old and new of Japanese aesthetics, updating and hybridizing the rich cultural traditions of matsuri and hanabi (fireworks). Hifana are represented by two Hanabi-shi (fireworks craftsmen) in this video, as they gradually re-energize a depressed city through the power of their beats, arriving at an enchanted temple where they unleash their final ultimate hanabi, triggering a colorful climax of explosive energy.
