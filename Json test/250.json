All of the demons have to pick a master on Earth and duke it out with other demons until one survives. Needless to say, Kiyomaro becomes Gash's master, and through their many battles, Kiyomaro learns the importance of friendship and courage.", "background": "The English release of the series under the name Zatch Bell! was edited, removing things like blood and nudity with Gash (Zatch in the English version) wearing boxers instead of being fully naked.
