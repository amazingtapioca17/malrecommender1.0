One day, she spots a strange cat crossing the road with a small present... and a truck headed straight for it! Haru doesn't even stop to think before jumping in front of the truck and getting them both to safety. This one selfless act initiates a chain of events that sends Haru on an epic adventure. The cat she saved turns out to be no ordinary feline, but Lune, Prince of the Cats. In honor of her bravery and for saving his life, he offers to marry her. Haru mutters a reply which is taken to be a \"yes,\" and for better or for worse, her fate is sealed. Alongside her cat companions Muta and the Baron, she's aided from above by a raven named Toto, and must travel to the cat world in order to rectify this misunderstanding. Her journey is tougher than it seems: If she cannot escape from the claws of the King of the Cats and find her true self, she will be turned into a cat forever. Haru may start off as an everyday girl, but after her descent into the world of cats, she returns a different beast entirely.", "background": "The Cat Returns is a spin-off of the movie Whisper of the Heart, and although some characters are crossed over, the stories in the two films are not related. Studio Ghibli began work on the movie as the 20 minute \u201cCat Project\u201d in 1999 for a theme park in Japan. Although the theme park cancelled the project, the 20 minute short film turned into a 45 minute project, and then a feature length film.\r\nThe movie was the second Studio Ghibli film to be directed by someone other than Hayao Miyazaki or Isao Takahata. It won an Excellence Prize at the 2002 Japan Media Arts Festival.", "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 1372, "type": "manga", "name": "Baron: Neko no Danshaku", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/1372/Baron__Neko_no_Danshaku"}], "Parent story": [{"mal_id": 585, "type": "anime", "name": "Mimi wo Sumaseba", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/585/Mimi_wo_Sumaseba"}]}, "producers": [], "licensors": [{"mal_id": 417, "type": "anime", "name": "Walt Disney Studios", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/417/Walt_Disney_Studios"}, {"mal_id": 783, "type": "anime", "name": "GKIDS", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/783/GKIDS"}], "studios": [{"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Ghibli", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/21/Studio_Ghibli"}], "genres": [{"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Kaze ni naru\" by Ayano Tsuji"]}
