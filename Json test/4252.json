Ray's examining an exciting new archeological discovery: a legendary temple located in an isolated area of the world. As always, she has with her a strange mirror that belonged to her father; a mirror that may provide access to a vanished civilization. On the excavation, Ray meets Mai and Mami Tachibana, freewheeling pubescent girls who heedlessly court danger. And danger they find, in the form of Rig Veda. Veda's after a big prize: Ray's mirror. But she will have to stop him at all costs, because if Veda gets his hands on the powerful object, he will possess secrets that could lead to disaster.", "background": null, "premiered": null, "broadcast": null, "related": {"Adaptation": [{"mal_id": 29221, "type": "manga", "name": "Explorer Woman Ray", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/manga/29221/Explorer_Woman_Ray"}]}, "producers": [{"mal_id": 48, "type": "anime", "name": "AIC", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/48/AIC"}, {"mal_id": 155, "type": "anime", "name": "animate Film", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/155/animate_Film"}, {"mal_id": 224, "type": "anime", "name": "Toshiba EMI", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/224/Toshiba_EMI"}], "licensors": [], "studios": [], "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "opening_themes": [], "ending_themes": ["\"Lights of Love\" by Tamaki Satou (\u4f50\u85e4\u74b0)"]}
